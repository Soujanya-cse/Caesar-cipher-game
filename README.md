# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Game

Welcome to the **Caesar Cipher Game**, a fun and interactive tool for encrypting and decrypting your messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique! 🎉

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 **Encrypt or Decrypt**: Shift the letters in your message to encode or decode it effortlessly.
- ✏️ **Preserves Special Characters**: Handles spaces, numbers, and symbols without modification.
- 🔁 **Restart Option**: Continue using the program as many times as you like.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Select an Operation**: Choose between `encode` (to encrypt) or `decode` (to decrypt) your message.
2. **Enter Your Message**: Input the text you want to process.
3. **Specify the Shift**: Provide a shift value (integer) that determines how the letters will be rotated.

The program will output the result and give you the option to run it again or exit.

## 🖼️ Example
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello world!
Type the shift number:
3
Here is the encoded result: khoor zruog!
Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise, type 'no':
no
